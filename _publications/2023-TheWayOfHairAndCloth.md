Abstract 
--------
This talk presents CreLoki, an extension to the multi-physics framework Loki. It enables unified creatures physics, such as hair and cloth in wet, dry, and underwater contexts with predefined coupling modes. By maintaining a solver setup configuration that is general enough for every foreseeable use case, CreLoki avoids the most tedious and error-prone steps of scene configuration. CreLoki also offers users a familiar interface via an Autodesk Maya plugin without compromising quality, customizability, or extendability. We found that this tool encourages a broader adoption of unified physics among creature artists.
