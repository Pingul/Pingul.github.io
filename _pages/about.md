Hi and welcome to my page! I am Joel Wretborn, a Simulation researcher at Wētā FX and PhD student at the University of Waterloo under supervision of Christopher Batty. My main area of interest is the animation of fluids, and in particular multi-phase media where a fluid couples with some other material. My work has been show-cased in movies such as Avengers: Endgame and Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes, and me and my colleagues were awarded the VES Emerging Technology Award for our work on fluids for Avatar 2: The Way of Water.
